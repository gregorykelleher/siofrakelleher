Hello, I'm SÃ­ofra Kelleher.

As a student of Business Information Systems at UCC, my interests lie in the interaction between technology and its novel application in business and society. Specifically, I hold a personal interest in connected health technologies and am an advocate for the diabetes technology community. My interests lie not just in computer science, but also the arts(literature, art, history and writing) and public speaking. I also row competitively.

You can get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:kelleher.siofra@gmail.com">kelleher.siofra@gmail.com</a>
