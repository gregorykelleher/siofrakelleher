Hello, I'm SÃ­ofra, a fifteen year old girl from Ireland who enjoys STEM, writing, travelling and playing ukulele that annoys all my family! I started this blog to showcase some of the technology I'm fiddling around with and all the mistakes I've been making. Down below, you can find me on Google+ but I will mostly be on this blog. Stay tuned!
