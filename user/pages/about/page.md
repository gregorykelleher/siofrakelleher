Hello, I'm SÃ­ofra Kelleher. I'm an 18 year old student living in Ireland. I started this website in 2015 to talk about technology but now I also talk about Diabetes T1, competitions I'm involved in and European Youth Parliament, an organisation I'm a part of. Other interests include rowing, cats and public speaking. To keep up to date with my latest goings on you can follow me on twitter @Siofra_Kelleher
