So, ‘what have you been up to?’ I hear you ask me. Well because I am now in Transition Year, I get to have my first experience in work! For the past two weeks I have been working in Cora Systems in their Carrick-on-Shannon offices. 


Cora Systems is a company that provides  “Enterprise Portfolio, Program and Project Management (E-PPM) solutions and services” for big clients, such as Intel and HSE. They were founded in 1999 by Pat Henry (the CTO) and Philip Martin (the CEO)


##Why Cora?
I decided to go to Cora Systems for my work experience because I wanted to find out about another side of a technology career that I had never seen before. I was really nervous on my first day but everyone was super friendly. Still, I could barely gather the courage to make it to the kitchen for lunch! Throughout the two weeks however I opened up and began to really enjoy talking to the people in the office. Everyone had funny stories to tell or interesting work they were doing to hear about.


##But what were you doing?
I was working on a project all by myself. The problem I had to try to fix was “how can teams share what they are working on in real time, in a way that does not create extra work?” another way of saying this is how can we improve internal communications in the office?
I had to decide what tools the office could be using to communicate that would be better than what they were already using. In order to decide this I had to interview, research, put together a report and present the project to a group! All in two weeks! It was a good thing I like to be busy or else I may have collapsed under all the work.


##My thoughts
I can’t believe I’m saying this but I loved working in the office. In fact yesterday was my first day back at school in work experience started and I was dreading it. It was so boring compared to all the exciting work and conversation in Cora Systems. I’m really happy and grateful that Cora Systems took me in because I believe it’s an experience I won’t be forgetting soon.
