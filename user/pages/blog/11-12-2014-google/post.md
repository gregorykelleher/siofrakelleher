I got to go to Google for a day! cake We weren't allowed to take photos but I snook this one of the lobby! It was a wonderful experience. I had a great talk with one of the 'Googlers' there. She really inspired me to look at STEM as a career and how she felt the same way I did at school.

It would be dream job to make it to here!
