I have exciting news! This past month I was awarded a Google Europe Students with Disabilities scholarship for my work in the diabetes technology community.

I will receive a â‚¬7k academic grant, as well as gain access to a network of current and past scholars.

Google is "committed to helping the innovators of the future make the most of their talents by providing scholarships for computer science students with disabilities." I am honoured to be a 2021 scholar and to have my efforts as a student recognised. Often, it is underestimated how much extra time and preparation disabled students must go through to participate wholly in education. Scholarships like this encourage and assist students like me that it is possible, despite the roadblocks we may face. I look forward to meeting and get to know the other scholars from 2021 and previous years, and see where I end up in the future.
I would like to thank Google for giving me the opportunity, and Dr Gaye Kiely from UCC and Lucia Macari from Overstock Sligo for their help.
