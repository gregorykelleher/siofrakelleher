Recently I turned 10. Not 10 years old, but 10 years a diabetic.
In the diabetes community this is a first in a long life of finish lines. Being able to live and manage a chronic illness for any amount of time is something worth celebrating, but reaching 10 years feels momentous. Due to the pandemic celebrations are delayed but I was happy to write this reflection on 10 years for D1 Now.
D1 Now is a research project funded by the Health Research Board. It aims to improve engagement between young adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and their healthcare providers and ultimately improve their self-management and diabetes-related health outcomes. I have been a member of the young adult panel since 2020.
