It is a dream come true for me to say I am officially a member of the International Diabetes Federation!

> The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is an umbrella organization of over 230 national diabetes associations in 170 countries and territories. It represents the interests of the growing number of people with diabetes and those at risk. The Federation has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950.

Their main activities are advocacy, epidemiology & research, education and care & prevention. You may know IDF from their World Diabetes Day campaign or the blue circle symbol of diabetes worldwide.

I was encouraged to apply to the IDF's Youth Leadership Lab by Grainne Flynn at [Blood Sugar Trampoline](https://bloodsugartrampoline.com/). My friends Prof Sean Dinneen and Dr Eimear Morrissey at [D1Now](https://d1now.ie) also supported me throughout the application process. However, as Ireland currently doesn't have a member organisation, according to the rules of the YLL, I may not be allowed to participate. I had an interview to see if I was the right candidate for the lab. 
## and it turns out I was!
I'm delighted to also be joined by another Irish diabetic and to be representing Ireland on a global stage like this.

So far it has been a great experience connecting with so many other diabetics across Europe and exploring the differences between our cultures and our experiences with diabetes. I look forward to my future with the International Diabetes Federation.
