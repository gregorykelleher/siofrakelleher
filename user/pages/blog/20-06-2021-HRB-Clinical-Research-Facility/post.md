For the past 2 months, I have been working part-time with the HRB Clinical Research Facility in Cork.

The HRB Clinical Research Coordination Ireland was being succeeded by the National Clinical Trials Office, hosted by UCC. I assisted with the IT transition of the HRB CRCI, using my skills in design skills, web development and project management systems. It was valuable to be able to put the knowledge learned in my degree into a real project. Despite completing many projects so far in my degree, the application to real-life situations is a unique opportunity.
My own experience on the young adult panel of the D1Now clinical trial also proved to be extremely useful as I had existing experience with the type of data and management systems the NCTO would require and use.

Sadly, I could not continue with the wonderful staff as I was offered a job with Boston Scientific, but I may return in September/October to offer more help with the IT transition.
