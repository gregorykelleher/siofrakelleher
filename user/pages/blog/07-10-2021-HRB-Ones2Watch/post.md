Ones2Watch is a conference hosted by the Health Research Board annually. It highlights research that is unique and is for early and mid-career researchers. 

D1Now was invited to present during their morning session on Public Patient Involvement Research. As D1Now is unique in having a young adult panel made up of 18-25 year old people with diabetes, we decided to create a small video to highlight everyone involved. I then participated in a Q&A session with our Study Lead, Prof Se√°n Dineen and Programme Manager, Dr Eimear Morrissey.
I always love to represent D1Now at conferences, as I believe what we are doing is the future of research and I think being able to give a more personal perspective leaves a lasting impression.

Luckily our session was recorded and is available for viewing!
