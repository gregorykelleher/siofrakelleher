Recently I got the opportunity to be interviewed by internationnally known Irish diabetes advocate, Gráinne Flynn.

You may know Gráinne from [Thriveabetes](https://thriveabetes.ie/) or her blog, [Blood Sugar Trampoline.](https://bloodsugartrampoline.com/) Funnily enough, I've known Gráinne since 2014!
While at Websummit representing Coderdojo, her husband(a coderdojo volunteer) got talking to my father and I and of course, diabetes came up. Contacts were swapped, and Gráinne has since been a fountain of knowledge for my family, as well as the Irish diabetes community.
Gráinne's unrelenting advocacy to get Irish diabetics heard and listened to has been a huge inspiration in my own advocacy journey, and as one of those diabetics I have seen the changes Gráinne and other advocates have made to the diabetes landscape.

Being able to speak to Gráinne about what education is like for a Type one was a unique opportunity and I can only hope that my own experiences will help others. I already have made an impact on a friend of mine, who contacted me to let me know that they had no idea how difficult it was to be a ceoliac and how much planning was required.
I hope these videos can help you in a similar way!
