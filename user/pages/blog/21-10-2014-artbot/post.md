I WON! A couple weeks back I was in a competition to select a bunch of kids to go to a robot making camp in Belgium, near Brussels. The competition took place at St. Angela's College near Sligo. And I won!

This means I get to got to Belgium and help build robots to make art. Here's the video describing the prize:
